Summary 
Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment

 Methodology
1.Two datasets were analyzed: daily Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed Index) and trade-level historical data from the Hyperliquid platform. 
2.The trade data was cleaned to handle malformed rows and ensure numeric consistency for PnL, trade size, fees, and prices. 
3.Timestamps were converted to a daily granularity to align both datasets.

*Trade-level data was aggregated to a trader-day level to compute key performance and behavior metrics, including daily PnL, win rate, number of trades, average trade size, fees, and long/short bias. 
*These metrics were merged with daily market sentiment to compare trader behavior and performance across Fear and Greed regimes. 
*Traders were further segmented by activity level and consistency to identify behavioral patterns across different groups.



 Key Insights
1. Performance varies with market sentiment
   *Traders generally exhibit weaker average performance and higher variability in daily PnL during Fear periods compared to Greed periods. 
   *Win rates also tend to be marginally higher during Greed days.

2. Behavioral shifts under Fear vs Greed
  * During Fear periods, traders reduce trade frequency and exposure, indicating risk-averse behavior. 
  *In contrast, Greed periods are associated with higher trade frequency and more aggressive positioning.

3. Segment-specific effects
  * High-activity traders benefit disproportionately during Greed periods but experience larger drawdowns during Fear periods.
  *More consistent traders show relatively stable performance across sentiment regimes.



Strategy Recommendations
1. Dynamic risk control
   High-activity traders should reduce leverage and trade frequency during Fear periods to limit drawdowns, while maintaining higher activity only during Greed periods.

2. Selective aggressiveness  
   Increased trading during Greed days should be restricted to traders with historically high win rates, as inconsistent traders tend to amplify losses during volatile sentiment shifts.



This analysis highlights that market sentiment influences not only returns but also trader behavior, and that sentiment-aware trading rules can improve risk-adjusted performance.
